# Dibble-Research

This repo is for internal use in Dibble's research group. Unless specified, the scripts here are written in Python and can be used in either Windows and Mac systems. The README file in each folder gives instructions on how to use the script in Windows and what it requires (e.g., making an input file, using directly on an output file).

1. [kintecus](./kintecus): script to analyze normalized sensitivity analysis Excel output from the [kinetic modeling software Kintecus](http://kintecus.com/)
2. [scan-geoms](./scan-geoms): script to extract successfully converged geometries from a scan [Gaussian](http://gaussian.com/scan/) output file. This feature is not available in [GaussView](http://gaussian.com/gaussview6/).
